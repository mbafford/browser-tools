# Tools

- [Image/Text to ICS (Calendar) Entry](image-to-ics) - Take an image (or text block) and extract an ICS file for adding to your calendar.  Screenshot a hotel reservation and let the LLM do the work of setting up dates/times/timezones/descriptions/etc.
- [Table Formatter](table-formatter) - Takes copy-and-paste of CSV, TSV, Markdown, table, or Google Sheets, and extracts the table and provides an easy copy to a multi-mime-type clipboard entry that can be pasted to Google Sheets, an email program as formatted email, or a text box as Markdown.
- [Loan Refinance Calculator](loan-refinance) - Refinance calculator - either enter terms manually, or paste in the details and it'll try to figure out the terms. Very US presumptive.
- [JWT Decoder](jwt-decode) - JWT decoder. Paste into browser. Similar to JWT.io, but in my control.
- [Base64 Image Decoder](base64-image) - Paste in a base64 image file and decode and display it in your browser. Also supports PDFs using pdf.js.
- [Date Difference Calculator](date-calculator) - Calculate number of days / weeks / years between two dates
- [Summarize JSON](summarize-json) - Summarize a complicated JSON object/array, showing the structure, data types, and sample values
