# Tools

- [Image/Text to ICS (Calendar) Entry](image-to-ics.html) - Take an image (or text block) and extract an ICS file for adding to your calendar.  Screenshot a hotel reservation and let the LLM do the work of setting up dates/times/timezones/descriptions/etc.
- [Table Formatter](table-formatter.html) - Takes copy-and-paste of CSV, TSV, Markdown, HTML table, or Google Sheets, and extracts the table and provides an easy copy to a multi-mime-type clipboard entry that can be pasted to Google Sheets, an email program as HTML formatted email, or a text box as Markdown.
- [Loan Refinance Calculator](loan-refinance.html) - Refinance calculator - either enter terms manually, or paste in the details and it'll try to figure out the terms. Very US presumptive.

# External Tools

- [Clipboard Viewer - Simon Willison](https://tools.simonwillison.net/clipboard-viewer) - See and extract the multiple entries stored in your clipboard.
